# CPS2004 Assignment

The code for the Village War Game can be found in the folder task 1.

The code for the Minesweeper can be found in the folder task 2.

Both folders have a compile.bat file and a run.bat file. The compile.bat file needs to be executed before the run.bat file in order for it to work correctly. Both run.bat files have a pause at the end so the window does not close as soon as the program finishes.
